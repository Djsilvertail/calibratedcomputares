        <p>
          I was born and raised in Canada, where I developed a lifelong
          fascination with computers and technology. My journey into
          professional coding began unexpectedly in my late twenties, when
          running my own Minecraft server introduced me to the basics of
          programming and sparked a passion for building and problem-solving.
        </p>

      <p>
        From that spark, I embarked on a dedicated journey to become a skilled
        developer. This included formal studies at Brigham Young
        University–Idaho, extensive self-directed learning through platforms
        like Codecademy, and countless hours honing my craft through personal
        projects. Through perseverance and continuous learning, I founded
        Calibrated Computares — a business built on a commitment to quality,
        creativity, and exceptional service.
