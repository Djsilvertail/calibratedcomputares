    <img src="/images/profile.png" alt="Profile picture">
    <p>I was born and raised in Canada. I have always found computers fascinating but didnâ€™t decide to become a computer coder until I played Minecraft in my late twenties. Running my own Minecraft server gave me a small taste of coding, and from there I started my journey. My journey includes schooling at BYU-I, personal studies from websites like Codecademy, and a lot of personal perseverance.</p>
